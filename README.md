# Tripflex

I have done this project in CSCI 5409 - Advance Cloud Computing during my Masters in Applied Computer Science.
This project is about trip management, where users can buy the trip package with some basic features. Here, the project's main importance is using various AWS cloud services. The front end is deployed on the EC2 instance. For this project, cloud formation is also used for how to auto-deploy or provision AWS cloud services by this script.
In this project, the frontend is used material UI to make the web application user interface minimal and responsive. For the backend, we use AWS services like lambda function with API gateway, Cognito for user management, SNS to send emails, Dynamo DB to store data and S3 to store images for the project.
